Description:
Our website “HealthIQ” is based on the healthcare theme. We have built the website in accordance to the facilities and services provided by NSUT covid center. The website has a home page which has information about the covid center and the services provided by the same. Next, it has links where one can donate and other where the user can check the location of the center. Lastly it has a graph displaying various statistics of the center.


Problems we faced and how we resolved:
Initially we were naming attributes carelessly without using proper names, and when we compiled our code, our website crashed. All things were here and there.
To resolve, we held multiple team meetings, properly planned the format and structure, and gave more meaningful attribute names, which prevented any overlapping and we could successfully compile our code on time.
Next, we were running short of time due to unseen failures and errors. We plan to work by keeping more backup time from next time.

What did we learn:
We learned to team work and cooperate as a team as this was our first Team Project.
We learned to use AM charts API and collected data from Delhi Healthcare website to make a Graph to show statistics of different diseases.
